/*This is for the Data Annotation coding challenge.  I've never done something like this.  
It feels like it is targetted for Senior level software engineers.  At the very least a 
good learning opportunity
--------------------
Challenge is to take a Google Doc from a User provided URL.  
The document will be parsed and then function must print a grid of characters
Should be printed in a fixed-width font
The characters in the grid will form a graphic
Which should show a sequence of uppercase letters
The letters will reveal a secret message
---------------------------------------------
The grid uses X,Y coordinates
min value is 0
max value is not limited
Any position in the grid that does not have a specified character should be filled w/ a "Space" character
*/

//Because the max value isn't limited something like an ArrayList seems easiest

class DecoderRing {
    
}
