To go back and solve for interview evaluations.

I've encountered a wide range of evaluation practices during job search 2024.  Some of them are definitely more difficult than others.  The ones I've found most challenging are the ones where they expect you to know some fairly in-depth syntax from off the top of one's head.  No reference material of any kind. With an extremely tight deadline.  If one has been doing the type of work as indicated by the prompt for ten years.  Then sure, not a big ask and works to identity the more experienced individuals from people still early in their careers.  So what if the job seeker gets that sort of prompt for an entry level position.  Would it be a reasonable ask then?  

In my most recent employment experience, one could simply reference whatever information that needed. I realize they are trying to prevent cheating but they are also capable of tracking what tabs are open and what they've been opened to.   

Regardless of my personal feelings, evaluations won't be going anywhere any time soon, so it is best to prepare and deal with them as best as one can.  

Hence this repository, the idea is to go back and attempt to finish any prompts that I can recall on my own time and ideally learning things along the way.

The secondary purpose is to go back and make improvements to the code after I believe I have satifisied the original prompt to the best of my recollection.
